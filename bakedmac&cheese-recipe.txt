Ingredients:
1 - 8oz package of elbow macaroni
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all purpose flour
2 cups milk
8 oz process Velveeta America cheese, cubed

Crumbled topping:
1 cup white bread crumbs
3 Tablespoons butter

Instructions:
Cook macaroni according to package directions, drain. Place in a greased 2 quart baking dish; set aside.

Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large heavy saucepan over low heat; whisk in flour until smooth. Cook 1 minute, whisking constantly. Gradually whisk in milk. Cook over medium heat; whisking constantly until mixture is thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat, and add cheese, stir until cheese melts. Pour cheese mixture over macaroni and mix well. 

Crumble up white bread to obtain 1 cup of bread crumbs. Pour melted butter into bread crumbs and mix well. Add to top of macaroni mixture

Bake uncovered at 375 for 30 minutes.

NOTE: I always double the mixture. People LOVE this stuff and it's always eaten up quick. A doubled batch should fit in a deep 9x13 pan.
